###Block Level Elements

1) <p> -- represents a paragraph of text. Until you start a new <p> tag,
there will not be a line break. Because paragraphs.

2) <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> -- varying levels of headers. h1 is
the largest, h6 the smallest. You can use them to make title-looking things.

3) <div> -- Separates and contains content. Super generic and is evidently
only used when no other element/tag is appropriate.

4) <blockquote> -- indicates the text within these tags is a quotation.
Visually, it renders with some slight indentation (which can be changed...).

5) <ol> -- represents an ordered list of items. Listing things within this
tag will organize the list with numbers, as opposed to bullet points or the
like.

6) <ul> --- represents an unordered list of items. Listing things within
this tag will organize the list with bullets typically.

7) <form> -- represents a section with interactive buttons and stuff users
can control to submit information to a web server.
