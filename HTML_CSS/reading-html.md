###Block Level Elements

1) ``<p>`` -- represents a paragraph of text. Until you start a new <p> tag,
there will not be a line break. Because paragraphs.

  Examples:

  [1] ``<p>You can find more information on our Meetup page: </p>``   (view-source:http://orlando.theironyard.com/)

  [2] ``<p>At 6pm tomorrow, The Iron Yard Orlando will be hosting Matt Wallaert, Behavioral Scientist @ Bing, as he speaks
  at an Orlando Tech Meetup in our space here at 101&#160;S. Garland Ave. This is a great opportunity to meet him and
  ask questions, and I hope you&#8217;ll join us! </p>``     (view-source:http://orlando.theironyard.com/)

  [3] ``<p>Hi everyone! This is my first official communication as the Campus Director at The Iron Yard Orlando, and I’m
  excited to let everyone know that I’m transitioning onto the team here over the next week. </p>`` (view-source:http://orlando.theironyard.com/)

2) ``<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`` -- varying levels of headers. h1 is
the largest, h6 the smallest. You can use them to make title-looking things.

3) <div> -- Separates and contains content. Super generic and is evidently
only used when no other element/tag is appropriate.

4) <blockquote> -- indicates the text within these tags is a quotation.
Visually, it renders with some slight indentation (which can be changed...).

5) <ol> -- represents an ordered list of items. Listing things within this
tag will organize the list with numbers, as opposed to bullet points or the
like.

6) <ul> --- represents an unordered list of items. Listing things within
this tag will organize the list with bullets typically.

7) <form> -- represents a section with interactive buttons and stuff users
can control to submit information to a web server.

8) <header> -- kind of an organizing attribute, this block usually contains
items pertaining to the head of a website, logos, banners, nav bar, and
the like.

9) <footer> -- another organizing attribute, this block might have stuff
about the author of the site, contact info, links to related data, copyright
info, etc.

10) <aside> -- represents a section of the page that could be considered
separate from the brunt of the webpage content. Might contain nav bar(s),
related advertisements, author bio, other web apps, profile info, links
to other related pages, etc.
