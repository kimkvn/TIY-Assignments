###Block Level Elements

####1) ``<p>``
* represents a paragraph of text. Until you start a new <p> tag,
there will not be a line break. Because paragraphs.

  Examples:

  [1] ``<p>You can find more information on our Meetup page: </p>``   (view-source:http://orlando.theironyard.com/)

  [2] ``<p>At 6pm tomorrow, The Iron Yard Orlando will be hosting Matt Wallaert, Behavioral Scientist @ Bing, as he speaks
  at an Orlando Tech Meetup in our space here at 101&#160;S. Garland Ave. This is a great opportunity to meet him and
  ask questions, and I hope you&#8217;ll join us! </p>``     (view-source:http://orlando.theironyard.com/)

  [3] ``<p>Hi everyone! This is my first official communication as the Campus Director at The Iron Yard Orlando, and I’m
  excited to let everyone know that I’m transitioning onto the team here over the next week. </p>`` (view-source:http://orlando.theironyard.com/)

####2) ``<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>``
* varying levels of headers. h1 is
the largest, h6 the smallest. You can use them to make title-looking things.

        <a href="/">The Iron Yard | Orlando</a>
