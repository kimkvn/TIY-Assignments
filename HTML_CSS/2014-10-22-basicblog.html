        <p>Hi everyone! This is my first official communication as the Campus Director at The Iron Yard Orlando, and I’m excited to let everyone know that I’m transitioning onto the team here over the next week.</p>

            See? Super excited. And it’s an official picture, because David is in it too (albeit without his actual knowledge)

       <h1><a href="http://orlando.theironyard.com/post/98822138374/welcome-to-week-2">Welcome to Week 2</a></h1>
       
       <p><???>By Sarah Elbadri, Campus Director</p>
       
       <p>We are officially in Week 2 at The Iron Yard! Very quickly, our students have demonstrated how much they can absorb and create in such a short time. So far they’ve been heavily exposed to Git and Github, Jekyll, and Cloud 9, and over the weekend built their blogs on Github Pages. As a campus they’ve also been using tools like Basecamp and HipChat, as well as practicing agile methodologies to communicate progress on their projects.</p>
       
       <p>On Friday, we kicked off our guest lecture series with <a href="http://olivierlacan.com/about/">Olivier Lacan</a> from Code School, who showed our students how Code School uses Github internally and demonstrated a couple neat <a href="http://olivierlacan.com/tools/">tools</a> that he uses to improve his workflow. </p>

       <p>This week our students are jumping into JavaScript! As a primer our students watched a great talk by Gary Bernhardt called the <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The Birth and Death of JavaScript</a> during lunch on yesterday. I’m pretty sure they’ll be calling it YavaScript on and off for the next 11 weeks.</p>

         <p><???>By Sarah Elbadri, Campus Director<???></p>
         
         <p><b>Here we are...</b></p>
         
         <p>The Iron Yard - Orlando’s inaugural class officially launched this morning! After a great dinner last night, breaking in the space with our friends and families, our class is in full Iron Yard mode. We have 14 awesome students that represent a diversity of age, backgrounds, and personalities. For those of you keeping up with our blog, we’ll post more about our individual students throughout the course of the class, and also highlight some of the blogging they’ll be doing to document their experience (the good, the bad, the ugly, and the “Ah ha!” moments) here at The Iron Yard.  </p>
         
         <p><b>First Day of School!</b></p>
         <p><???>We were lucky to have Eric Dodds, a partner at The Iron Yard, in the house to talk to our students about our mission as an organization. It’s something that everyone who’s reading this should <a href="http://theironyard.com/">read through</a>, but what I’d like to reiterate about Eric’s talk is our commitment to “training the highest-quality developers in the world, <b>both in skill and in character.</b>" While we’re preparing our students to be professional programmers, we’re also helping to grow the tech community and foster good, global citizens. This isn’t just about 12 weeks in a class— this is about unleashing productive problem solvers with a view of programming as life-long study into the world to make it a better place for everyone. </p>
         
         <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/30df254e641aaabb85378540108e9ef3/tumblr_inline_ncbt9ycfuc1t0hk69.jpg"/>
         
         <p>After Eric’s kickoff and a welcome from me going over the logistics of our campus, our Front End Instructor David Rogers, known to many in the tech community as “Al_The_X”, took over, circled up the class, and initiated our inaugural, daily morning stand-up by asking our students to answer 3 simple questions:</p>
         
         <ul>
           <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
           <li>What are you doing today?</li>
           <li>What, if anything, is in your way?</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>This is going to be standard operating procedure for our class moving forward, but it was interesting to hear how each of our students spent their time preparing for the first day of class, which ranged from finishing up pre-work David assigned, to reviewing Code School courses, to mentally preparing for these 12 weeks with mediation. </p>
         
         <p>While our class has just started, we’re all looking forward to the epic journey this will be for our students!  It’s going to be really difficult for all them, and probably one of the greatest challenges they’ll ever face, but it’s incredible how much they’ll learn in 12 weeks and where they’ll be after The Iron Yard. Today was just Day 1!</p>
